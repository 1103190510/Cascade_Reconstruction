# Cascade_Reconstruction
Tensorflow implementation of "A cascade reconstruction model with generalization ability evaluation for anomaly detection in videos" by Yuanhong Zhong, Xia Chen, Jinyang Jiang, Fan Ren.

## Datasets
* USCD Ped2 [[dataset](https://github.com/StevenLiuWen/ano_pred_cvpr2018)]
* CUHK Avenue [[dataset](https://github.com/StevenLiuWen/ano_pred_cvpr2018)]
* ShanghaiTech [[dataset](https://github.com/StevenLiuWen/ano_pred_cvpr2018)]

These datasets are from an official github of "Future Frame Prediction for Anomaly Detection - A New Baseline (CVPR 2018)".The calculation of optical flow refers to "[43]	C. Liu, Beyond pixels: Exploring new representations and applications for motion analysis, Doctoral Thesis. MIT. (2009).".


Finally, we are very sorry that we only give the code of the main piece of the whole project, because we do not have time to sort out to get a final and perfect version.
